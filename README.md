# Julia support for Atom

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JuliaEditorSupport/atom-language-julia.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JuliaEditorSupport/atom-language-julia)

Atom package for the Julia language. Originally based off of [JuliaLang/julia.tmBundle](https://github.com/JuliaLang/Julia.tmbundle), merged with new ideas from [language-julia](https://github.com/tpoisot/language-julia/blob/master/README.md) package.

## Features:

- Syntax highlighting
- Snippets for common Julia keywords and constructs (see `snippets/language-julia.cson`)
- Toggle folding of docstrings

## Installation

Installation happens normally either through `apm install language-julia` or through the install section of the settings tab within Atom.

Note: if you already have a different version of language-julia plugin installed (e.g. [this one](https://github.com/tpoisot/language-julia)), you would need to remove it first using `apm uninstall language-julia`

## Recommended Extras

* The [Latex Completions](https://github.com/JunoLab/atom-latex-completions)
  package provides support for unicode characters similarly to the Julia REPL.
* The [Indent Detective](https://github.com/JunoLab/atom-indent-detective) package will help you keep to the style guidelines when working on Base or packages.

## Toggling docstrings

Two Atom commands are provided to toggle all docstrings or the docstring under the cursor: `language-julia:toggle-docstrings` and `language-julia:toggle-all-docstrings`. These are not assigned keys. Here is one example of adding these to keymaps using org-mode style keys:

```
'atom-text-editor[data-grammar="source julia"]:not([mini])':
  'tab':       'language-julia:toggle-docstrings'
  'shift-tab': 'language-julia:toggle-all-docstrings'
```

## Contributing

We love contributors. Here are the steps we have taken to develop on this package:

1. Remove the official install of the package: `apm uninstall language-julia`
2. Clone the repository somewhere we can remember: `git clone git@github.com:JuliaEditorSupport/atom-language-julia.git`
3. Link the cloned package to `~/.atom` (enter the following from the root of the repo directory): `apm link .`
4. Hack away!

When new features are added, you should write specs to show that the package is behaving as expected. To run the specs you need to do the following:

- Make sure you have the library's folder open in the current atom project.
- Then open the command pallete and select `Window: Run package specs`. On OSX this key-binding is `ctrl+cmd+option+p`.

This should open up a new window with the spec results.
